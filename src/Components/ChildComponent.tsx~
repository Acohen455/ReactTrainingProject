/* This component takes props of ChildProps type. What is that, and what is props?
*
*
* Props (short for "properties") is the data we pass (ie. send in) from a Parent Component
* ParentComponent will render a ChildComponent in its return() and pass some values to it
* These are the props that ChildComponent will receive
*
* We defined an interface (which is more like a Java Model Class than a Java interface)
*
